			<p><a href="http://thepeoplesebook.net">The People's E-Book</a> seeks to be a lab, an incubator, an e-book creation platform for artists, authors, and alternative presses who want to try new things, publish new books, and push into new territories. The People's E-Book will handle e-books of all sizes and scope, but it will excel in areas that no one else has cared to considerâ€”the very small, the quick and dirty, the simple and the experimental.</p>
			<p>The People's E-Book is a tool that doesn't account for what e-books <em>are</em>, but rather lets its users imagine what they <em>can be</em>: A short story or an epic poem, a blog post, a manifesto, a photobook, a book of moving photos, a book with a single word, a book with every word, sixteen-million colors, nine swimming pools, a video diary, an idea ...</p>
			<p>Make alternative e-books possible. Join us in building The People's E-Book, a remarkable DIY tool <strong>anyone can use for free</strong></p>
